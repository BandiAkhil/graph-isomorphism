Running the program

=======================


Important Notes

-------------

The file that is needed to run the instances is main.py which can be found inside the main folder of the project

All the instructions mentioned in the next steps are related to main.py file



How To Run It?

-------------

1) To check the GI problem from a list of graphs, use the main() function call at the very end of the file with the argument "iso". So, main("iso").

2) To check the Automorphism from a list of graphs use main() function call with the argument "auto". So, main("auto")

3) To check for the GI problem and Automorphisms at once from a list of graphs, use the main() function call with argument "iso auto". So, main("iso auto")



How To Change The Instances?

-------------

In order to change the instances just edit the argument of open('../basic/basicGI3') function to the instance that you want to check. This function can be found at the end of the file inside the function main()

For running basic instances just use "../basic/instancefile"

For running the examples from canvas use "../canvasExamples/instancefile"
